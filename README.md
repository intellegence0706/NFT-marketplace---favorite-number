## Known errors
**Minting does not work**
- Solution:
  Minting is currently only allowed by the owner of the NFT contract.
  Check that the address from which the contracts were deployed matches the
  address from which one calls `mint()`

**Attempting to run transaction which calls a contract function, but recipient address 0x... is not a contract address**
- Solution:
  Delete `.json` files in `build/contracts/` and redeploy contracts

**Nonce of account is not correct**
- Solution:
  Go to MetaMask -> Settings -> scroll to the bottom -> select `Reset Account`

**`bid()` reverts/out of gas**
- Solution:
  Use more gas ;-)

## TODO's
* [ ] add discoverability for auctions to NFTDutchAuction.sol (see: NFTokenEnumerable.sol `function tokenOfOwnerByIndex(address _owner, uint256 _index)`)
* [ ] add possibility to cancel auctions
* [ ] reduce gas cost of NFTDutchAuction.sol functions
* [ ] rework search for numbers: add steps, show min and max, etc.
* [ ] add notifications
* [x] handle non web3 compatible browsers
* [x] update to new MetaMask injection format
* [ ] inventory: when calling getOwnedNFT() do not loop over 0 -> display message "currently no NFT's owned"
* [ ] unify used time units (currently hours and minutes)
